# The-Game-Rock_Paper_Scissors
The characters are Rock, Paper, Scissors

A brief summary:
    If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
    Rock beats Scissors
    Paper beats Rock
    Scissors beats Paper

The game was design to be played between a player and computer. 

The python method "Random" was imported to initiate random selection for computer.

it was looped to request for new entry when a player enters a wrong character.

If the game ends either with a Tie!, WIn!, or Lose! the game requests if the player will like to continue the game.
